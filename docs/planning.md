# ðŸ“„ Planning Document â€“ Inventory Management System

## 1. Project Vision

The Inventory Management System will help electronics developers efficiently organize and track electronic components. The system aims to solve the problem of losing track of parts, over-purchasing, and struggling to quickly find required components.

## 2. Problem Statement

Electronics enthusiasts, students, and small labs often accumulate hundreds of components (resistors, ICs, sensors, MOSFETs, dev boards). Without a proper inventory system, it becomes difficult to:

- Track available stock.
- Avoid duplicate purchases.
- Locate components quickly.
- Monitor usage and cost trends.

## 3. Objectives

- Provide a digital platform to manage component inventory.
- Enable quick search, filtering, and categorization of parts.
- Track stock levels with alerts for low quantity.
- Maintain supplier, datasheet, and pricing info.
- Provide a dashboard with analytics on usage and stock.

## 4. Target Users

- Primary User: Individual developer (personal lab inventory).
- Secondary Users:
- Makerspaces
- University labs
- Small electronics startups

- User Roles
- Admin: Full access (add/edit/remove stock, manage users).
- User: View/search inventory, request components.

## 5. Feasibility Study

- Technical Feasibility
- Frontend: React / Next.js
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas for cloud hosting)
- Deployment: Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
- Optional IoT Integration: ESP32 with REST API

- Economic Feasibility
- Cloud hosting via free tiers (Vercel, Railway, MongoDB Atlas).
- No major cost for MVP.

- Operational Feasibility
- System designed for daily usability.
- Easy adoption by electronics developers and labs.

- Time Feasibility
- MVP within 4â€“6 weeks (part-time).
- Advanced features in later sprints.

## 6. Scope

### In-Scope (MVP)

- Add/update/delete components.
- Search and filter components.
- Stock management (increment/decrement).
- Low-stock alerts.
- Authentication (basic user login).
- Dashboard overview.

### Out-of-Scope (Future Features)

- QR/Barcode scanning.
- ESP32 hardware interface.
- Multi-user with roles & permissions.
- Export BOM (CSV/Excel).
- Cloud synchronization with multiple devices.

## 7. Risks & Mitigation

```
Risk	                                Impact	                    Mitigation
Database may grow large	                Medium	                    Use indexing, optimize queries
Over-engineering features early	        High	                    Focus on MVP, Agile sprints
Hosting issues (free-tier limits)	    Low	                        Plan Docker-based fallback
Security vulnerabilities	            Medium	                    Use JWT auth, input sanitization
Time overruns	                        Medium	                    Set weekly milestones, track progress
```

## 8. Project Plan
